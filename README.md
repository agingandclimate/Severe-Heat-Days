It demonstrates how to construct severe heat measures using the UTCI data. It starts by showing data manipulation from raster to a tabular dataset that obtains UTCI values for each municipality in Mexico. Then, it presents how to map and analyze such data. Finally, it shows how to count the number of days of severe heat (32°C UTCI and above).
